# Agent compatibility matrix

What Gommage sees, what it does not, and what can bypass it per agent. This page is written against **current upstream state (April 2026)**. If an agent changes its hook surface, this page moves accordingly; the packaged capability mapper stdlib in `crates/gommage-stdlib/capabilities/` is agent-agnostic and usually does not need code changes. The repository-root `capabilities/` directory is a review-friendly mirror kept in sync by CI.

If an item is listed as "Bypasses Gommage", that is not a vulnerability — it is the boundary of what a PreToolUse-level interception layer can observe. Stack OS-level confinement (AppArmor, SELinux, `seccomp-bpf`, macOS Seatbelt, Codex `--sandbox`) under Gommage for anything you need caught below the agent layer.

After installing an integration, run `gommage verify --json` to verify the operator path and built-in mapper + policy semantics. If the repository carries policy fixtures, run `gommage verify --json --policy-test <file>` before trusting the hook. A top-level verify `warn` is still an operable install when the only warnings are the missing first audit log or missing daemon socket. A top-level verify `fail` means the hook should not be trusted yet. See [`diagnostics.md`](diagnostics.md).

## Claude Code (Anthropic)

### What Gommage sees via `PreToolUse` hook

| Tool | Forwarded input | Capability namespace |
|---|---|---|
| `Bash` | `command` | `proc.exec:*`, plus every rule that matches the command (`git.push:*`, `net.out:*`, `pkg.*`, `deploy.*`, `docker.*`, `k8s.*`, `terraform.*`, `aws.*`, `gh.*`) |
| `Read` | `file_path` | `fs.read:<path>` |
| `Write` | `file_path` | `fs.write:<path>` |
| `Edit` | `file_path` | `fs.write:<path>` |
| `MultiEdit` | `file_path` | `fs.write:<path>` |
| `NotebookEdit` | `notebook_path` | `fs.write:<notebook_path>` |
| `Glob` | `pattern` | `fs.read:<pattern>` |
| `Grep` | `pattern`, `path`, `glob`; hook `cwd` is copied into reserved `__gommage_*` fields when needed | `fs.search:<path-or-glob>`, `fs.read:<path-or-glob>` |
| `WebFetch` | `url` | `net.fetch:<host>`, `net.out:<host>` |
| `WebSearch` | `query` | `net.search:web`, `net.search.query:<query>` |
| `mcp__<server>__<tool>` | full MCP tool name | `mcp.write:<tool>`, `mcp.read:<tool>`, `mcp.call:<tool>` depending on verb-like prefixes |

To extend coverage, add a mapper rule under `~/.gommage/capabilities.d/` — Claude Code forwards the full `tool_name` + `tool_input` object on every hook call. The stdlib defaults intentionally require pictos for WebFetch, WebSearch, write-like MCP tools, and unclassified MCP calls.

`gommage quickstart --agent claude` installs the hook and imports supported
`permissions.deny` entries from `~/.claude/settings.json` into
`~/.gommage/policy.d/05-claude-import.yaml`. Narrow supported
`permissions.allow` entries such as `Bash(git status *)` and
`Read(./docs/**)` are imported into
`~/.gommage/policy.d/90-claude-allow-import.yaml`, which loads after bundled
deny and ask rules so Gommage guardrails still win. Broad native allow rules
such as `Bash` or `*` stay in Claude's config; Gommage remains fail-closed
unless a policy rule allows the mapped capability.

Verify the host wiring after quickstart with:

```sh
gommage agent status claude --json
```

This checks the Claude settings file, the installed `PreToolUse` hook group,
and generated native permission import files without parsing the JSON settings
by hand.

### Bypasses Gommage under Claude Code

- Tool calls that Claude Code chooses to route below the hook (extremely unusual).
- Any shell command the user executes directly in a terminal outside the Claude Code session.
- Subprocess fork-chains inside a Bash call: Gommage sees the top-level `command` string only. If the command spawns `sh -c '…'` that spawns another, only the outermost string is in `input.command`. Wrapper-evasion hardstops (see `hardstop.rs`) catch the classic shapes; novel wrappers are a hole until added to the stdlib.

### Recommended stack

Claude Code does not ship OS-level sandboxing. If you need it:

- macOS: run Claude Code under `sandbox-exec` with a profile that limits writable paths.
- Linux: run under `bwrap` or a container with a tight bind-mount set.
- Everywhere: `git-hook`-style pre-commit + pre-push fallback if a `git push` gets past the in-session layer.

## OpenAI Codex CLI

### What Gommage sees via `PreToolUse` hook

Codex's `PreToolUse` hook (as of the 2026-04 upstream state, tracked at [openai/codex#16732](https://github.com/openai/codex/issues/16732)) fires **only for `Bash` tool calls**. Every file-touching tool Codex has built in (its `read_file`, `apply_patch`, and MCP-delivered file tools) goes through without entering Gommage's decision path.

| Tool | Hook fires? | Capability produced |
|---|---|---|
| `Bash` | **yes** | same as Claude Code's Bash mapping |
| `read_file` (Codex built-in) | no | — |
| `apply_patch` / `str_replace` (Codex built-in) | no | — |
| MCP-delivered tools | no (at the PreToolUse layer) | — |

### Bypasses Gommage under Codex

- Every file read and file edit Codex performs via its internal tools.
- Every MCP tool Codex calls through.
- Any action the approval policy auto-approves at the sandbox layer before the hook fires.

### Recommended stack

Codex ships OS-level confinement as a first-class feature — **use it**:

| Sandbox mode | Reads | Writes | Network | Shell |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `--sandbox read-only` (default) | anywhere | none | none | allowed via hook |
| `--sandbox workspace-write` | anywhere | cwd only | none | allowed via hook |
| `--sandbox danger-full-access` | anywhere | anywhere | anywhere | allowed via hook |

Gommage + Codex is a layered posture: Codex's OS-level sandbox covers the file-touching gap that Gommage cannot see at the hook layer; Gommage governs the Bash surface declaratively and audits.

For MCP tools that can be routed through a stdio proxy, `gommage-mcp
--gateway --server-name <name> -- <upstream-command>` provides a narrower
alternative to relying on the Codex hook. The gateway evaluates MCP
`tools/call` requests as `mcp__<name>__<tool>`, forwards allowed calls, and
returns an MCP tool error without forwarding denied or picto-required calls.
This does not cover Codex built-in file tools and does not replace Codex's OS
sandbox.

Typical combos:

```sh
# Audit run — read-only, Gommage governs the occasional shell call.
codex exec --sandbox read-only "audit this repo"

# Refactor run — Codex can patch files within cwd (kernel-enforced),
# Gommage governs any Bash the agent wants to run.
codex exec --sandbox workspace-write "apply the refactor we discussed"

# MCP server through Gommage's stdio gateway.
gommage-mcp --gateway --server-name filesystem -- <stdio-mcp-server> .
```

### Wiring

See [`examples/codex-setup.md`](../examples/codex-setup.md).
`gommage quickstart --agent codex` writes `~/.codex/hooks.json` and enables
`features.codex_hooks = true`, but it does not convert Codex's OS sandbox or
approval policy into Gommage YAML. Those native controls remain authoritative
for non-Bash surfaces.

Verify the host wiring after quickstart with:

```sh
gommage agent status codex --json
```

This checks `hooks.json`, `config.toml`, `features.codex_hooks`, the installed
`PreToolUse` hook group, and warns when `sandbox_mode = "danger-full-access"`
because Codex file and MCP tools remain outside Gommage's current hook coverage.

## Why not Cursor, Aider, Cline, Continue, Zed yet

Each fails at least one of: has no hook API, has a hook API that runs after the native permission layer (so our deny cannot override a user's auto-approve), or has documented permission-bypass bugs that make layering fragile.

| Agent | Hook type | Blocker for Gommage today |
|---|---|---|
| **Cursor** | `beforeShellExecution`, `beforeMCPExecution`, `preToolUse` | Hooks run **after** built-in permission checks — cannot override enterprise auto-approve |
| **Aider** | none documented | No extensibility point |
| **Cline** | `PostToolUse`-style | Permission bypass bugs open upstream ([cline/cline#7334](https://github.com/cline/cline/issues/7334)) |
| **Continue** | `PreToolUse` (incomplete) | "Does not intercept all shell calls yet" per upstream |
| **Zed** | regex-in-config only | No programmatic interception |

Revisit when upstream ships a stable, pre-authorisation hook. Roadmap tracks each of these as a separate gate.

## Updating this page

Add a row to the matrix when a mapper rule lands. Upstream hook surface changes invalidate this doc — raise a PR to correct the "Bypasses Gommage" list the same day the upstream change ships. The doc is part of Gommage's trust claim; stale rows are a credibility bug.
